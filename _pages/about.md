Hi, I'm Ryan!  
I'm a Mechanical Engineer with a BSc from UMass Lowell.  
Currently building some 3D printers at Formlabs.  
I like to create whatever I find interesting, and understand what makes the machines/technology around me work.

Check out some of my projects [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects).
