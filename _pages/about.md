Hi, I'm Ryan!<br>
I'm a Mechanical Engineer with a BSc from UMass Lowell.<br>
Currently building some 3D printers at Formlabs.<br>
I like to create whatever I find interesting, and understand what makes the machines/technology around me work.

Here's some of the [things I've been up to]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects).
