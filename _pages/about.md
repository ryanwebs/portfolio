i, I'm Ryan!<br>

I'm a Mechanical Engineer from Danvers MA, with a BSc from UMass Lowell. I like to create things I find interesting, and understand what makes the machines/technology around me work.<br>

Currently building some 3D printers at [Formlabs](https://formlabs.com/).

Here's some of the [projects I've worked on!]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects)
