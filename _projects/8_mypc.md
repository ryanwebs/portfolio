My first custom PC build, with sufficient performance for CAD,
Fluid Simulation, Structural FEA, and video games.

Not really an engineering project, but required proper research to understand each component of the
computer’s function, and how to choose the correct components for a rig.

- Gigabyte Vision RTX 3060 ti, 8GB VRAM
- Intel Core i5 10600K
- 16 GB RAM
