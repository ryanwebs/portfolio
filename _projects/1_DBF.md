For my Capstone design class, my team designed a remote control airplane for the AIAA's annual Design, Build, Fly competition. I was responsible for designing the electronic propulsion system (motor, battery, speed controller, propeller), designing custom 3D printed structural components, and developing the manufacturing process for the airplane.

## Design

Talk about the plane's design constraints here!

## Propulsion System

Talk about how you chose the electronics here! 

Brushless DC selection, targeted kV, target thrust, ESC amperage, prop diameter and pitch.

Show the torque curves for the motors you were considering and why you chose the one you did!

Add some pictures!

## Testing Motor Thrust, and Control Surface Servos

Tested thrust of propeller and motor using two 20kg load cells and AC ammeter.

Converted mv/V readings to N, to ensure sufficient thrust (targeted ~70% of plane weight)

Tested for power draw, and battery life at multiple throttles to ensure sufficient flight time.

## Manufacturing

Talk about how you built the plane here!

I lasercut the chassis from foam/cardboard, developed the manufacturing process, and built the entire airplane! I also 3D printed some spar connectors, and control surface mounts out of LDPLA!

Show how painful it was to kerf cut all the foam board for the wing!

Add some pictures!

## CAD Drawings

Add pictures of the CAD drawings for some of the structural components you designed!
