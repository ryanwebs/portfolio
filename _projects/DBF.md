For my Capstone design class, my team designed a remote control airplane for the AIAA's annual Design, Build, Fly competition. I was responsible for designing the electronic propulsion system (motor, battery, speed controller, propeller), designing custom 3D printed structural components, and developing the manufacturing process for the airplane.

## Design

Talk about the plane's design constraints here!

## Propulsion System

Talk about how you chose the electronics here! Brushless DC selection, targeted kV, target thrust, ESC amperage, prop diameter and pitch.

## Testing Motor Thrust, and Control Surface Servos

Tested thrust of propeller and motor using
two 20kg load cells and AC ammeter.

Converted mv/V readings to N, to ensure
sufficient thrust (targeted ~70% of plane
weight)

• Tested for power draw, and battery life at
multiple throttles to ensure sufficient flight
time.

## Manufacturing

Talk about how you built the plane here!
I lasercut the chassis from foam/cardboard, and Developed the airplane’s manufacturing
I also 3D printed some spar connectors, and control surface mounts out of LDPLA!
Show how painful it was to kerf cut all the foam board for the wing!
