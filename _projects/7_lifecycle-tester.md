I designed this pneumatic test fixture during my Spring 2023 Mechanical Engineering co-op at Teradyne.

- Identified a plastic pin connector
bracket with a high defect rate.

- Designed a pneumatic lifecycle
tester that mimics the loading
conditions on the bracket in the
higher-level assembly.

- Selected a new material for the
brackets, then tested for fatigue
and mechanical failure by
compressing/decompressing the
pins for 10,000 cycles.

- Validated FEA results for the new
material selection before moving
forward with high volume
production.
