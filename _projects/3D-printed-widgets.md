Sometimes the best way to use your 3D printer is when you think: "it would really be useful for me to have this hyperspecific plastic thing right about now", spend a little bit in CAD, and have it in your hands a few hours later.

Here's some of my favorite stuff spawned from that thought process.

## Cribbage Board

A Bruins-themed cribbage board that I designed as a gift for my Dad. Includes a compartment on the bottom for storing a deck of cards and pegs. I took some inspiration from those click-in-place battery doors.

## Commander Deckbox

A little box for holding my Magic: The Gathering cards.

## Peg Board Hooks

A collection of hooks for mounting tools to my peg board.

## Spice Rack

A spice rack that fits over the lip of my kitchen counter, printed in four pieces and then epoxied together.

## Beer Tap Handles

Custom tap handles and plaque for my Dad's home-brewing project. A threaded insert is epoxied into the bottom of the tap handles to interface with the taps.

## Cookie Cutter

A custom cookie cutter for a cookie making contest.

## Snap-On Brush Hooks

Snap-on brush hooks for holding dish brushes on a rail over my kitchen sink.

## Window Box Brackets

Simple brackets to mount a window box to a window sill in my apartment. The window box only has to be set into the brackets, and can easily be lifted out of the way to open the window.
