Sometimes the best way to use your 3D printer is when you think: "it would really be useful for me to have this hyperspecific plastic thing right about now", then spend a little bit in CAD and have it a few hours later.

Here's some of my favorite stuff spawned from that thought process.

## Cribbage Board

A Bruins-themed cribbage board that I designed as a gift for my Dad. Includes a compartment on the bottom for storing a deck of cards and pegs. I took some inspiration from those click-in-place battery doors.

</div>


## Commander Deckbox

A little box for holding my Magic: The Gathering cards.

## Guitar Wall Hangers

Some hooks for mounting my guitars to the wall. I oriented the grain in line with the bending moment, and printed them at 100% infill in ABS. I wasn't taking any chances, and I haven't seen any creep in them yet so that's good.
