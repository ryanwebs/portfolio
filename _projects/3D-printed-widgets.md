Sometimes the best way to use your 3D printer is when you think: "it would really be useful for me to have this hyperspecific plastic thing right about now", then spend a little bit in CAD and have it a few hours later.

Here's some of my favorite stuff spawned from that thought process.

## Cribbage Board

A Bruins-themed cribbage board that I designed as a gift for my Dad. Includes a compartment on the bottom for storing a deck of cards and pegs. I took some inspiration from those click-in-place battery doors.

## Commander Deckbox

A little box for holding my Magic: The Gathering cards. Fits about 115 cards for a full commander deck plus token cards.

## Guitar Wall Hangers

Some hooks for mounting my guitars to the wall. I oriented the grain in line with the bending moment, and printed them at 100% infill in ABS. I wasn't taking any chances, and I haven't seen any creep in them yet so that's good.

## Mug Holder

Got tired of reaching down to the ground every time I wanted to take of sip of tea. This slides into place on the side of my bed frame.

## Trunk Wall Hook

Little hooks that click onto the grocery net mounting points in my trunk. Lets me secure my tool crate using a bungee cord. Finally, my tools don't spill everywhere every time I u-turn.

## Kickstand Buddy

The legs of my golf bag's kickstand used to get stuck under the rods, and not deploy correctly. VERY annoying. Not anymore, though. This clip press fits onto the kickstand rods, and the legs rest on top when the bag is lifted.

</div>

## Torsion Spring Winding Jig

I let go of a constant force spring once. It was a bad idea. I didn't want to buy another one, so I designed this jig that let me rewind it with a drill chuck.

## Replacement Car Armrest Bracket

There's these plastic brackets in my car that hold up the center console armrest. They have pin slots so the armrest can pivot up and down. One of them broke, and the entire armrest fell. It's hard to buy replacement parts for a car from 2002, so I ended up taking some measurements of the broken pieces and printing a new one.
